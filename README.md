# From Pixels to Politics: A Validation-Centric Approach for Clustering Congressional Social Images

This project focuses on analyzing a vast Instagram dataset, comprising images from both Democrat and Republican congress members, to discern political affiliations. Given the absence of labeled real-world image datasets, the challenge was to develop a scalable clustering framework. By leveraging deep learning models like ResNet50 and VGGFace, combined with techniques such as transfer learning and self-supervised learning, the project aimed to categorize images effectively. 

The primary goal was to extract meaningful visual features from the images, cluster them into coherent groups, and validate these clusters to derive social insights without relying on ground truth labels. Ultimately, the project sought to provide a nuanced understanding of political narratives as portrayed through social media imagery
